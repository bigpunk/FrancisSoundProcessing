# FrancisSoundProcessing
Basic iOS app to test out AudioKit sound analysis

To get started make sure you have cocoapods on your machine.  Then run `pod install`
For now you must delete the Pods/Header dir to working around an AudioKit/Cocoapods non-modular 
header issue.  (ex) rm -rf  Pods/Headers

Now open the FrancisSoundProcessing.xcworkspace in xcode.
